# MT-arduino-rotary-encoder

Rotary encoder library for the Arduino platform, to detect encoder detent/rotation direction and angular position.

This library implements non-blocking functions to detect encoder rotation actions, ensuring each action is debounced to filter out input noise on the contact pins. The library can handle multiple encoders.
