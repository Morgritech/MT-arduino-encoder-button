Rotary encoder library for the Arduino platform, to detect encoder detent/rotation direction and angular position.

This library implements non-blocking functions to detect encoder rotation actions. The library can handle multiple encoders.

For rotary encoders with an integrated push-button switch, this library can be used with the [MT-arduino-momentary-button](https://github.com/Morgritech/MT-arduino-momentary-button) library.

See the [examples](examples) folder for how to get started on using the library.

This library can be installed via the Arduino Library Manager.
